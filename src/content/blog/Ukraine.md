# Ukraine – A Glimpse into Life During War

It has been over a year and a half since the war in Ukraine began on February 24, 2022. In that time, around 6.28 million people have fled the country—an enormous share of its 43.79 million residents (as of 2021). Civilian casualties are staggering: 9,511 recorded deaths and 17,206 injuries, though the real numbers are likely higher at the Time.

# Arrival in Kyiv

My journey began in mid-July 2023 in Kyiv, where I first needed to take care of paperwork to help me move more freely within the country.

Surprisingly, the impact of war in Kyiv is barely noticable as Outsider. Life continues, and people go about their daily routines. This creates a stark contrast to the images many outside Ukraine associate with a country at war. Despite the ongoing conflict and refugee crisis, the Daily Live in the capital feels strangely untouched in many ways. This doesnt mean that when you look for it you cant find Signs of the War in any Corner.

# Living in Kherson

I spent four weeks in Kherson, and the reality there was dramatically different.

Located in southern Ukraine on the Dnieper River, Kherson is just across from Russian-occupied territory. Artillery attacks from the other side of the river are frequent. Before the war, the city had a population of about 283,649 (2021)—but by 2023, only around 40,000 residents remained.

On July 6, 2023, Russian troops destroyed a major dam, flooding large parts of Kherson. The resulting devastation was massive. Streets and homes were swallowed by water, leaving behind destruction, trauma, and despair.

During my stay, I was hosted by a grassroots aid organization called Spravzhni, founded by locals to support those who stayed. The group also became a hub for young Ukrainian volunteers and international helpers from countries like Norway, the USA, Sweden, Spain, and Germany. Together, we tried to bring help and hope to the people of Kherson.

# On the Ground: Our Daily Tasks

Our main tasks were varied:

    - Distributing food and clean water to affected residents

    - Clearing out homes and basements filled with up to 1.5 meters of mud, often mixed with destroyed personal belongings

    - Removing rubble caused by shelling and fires

    - Caring for abandoned pets and animals

These efforts weren't just about rebuilding homes—they were about restoring dignity, safety, and stability in a place where war had taken so much.

Despite everything, this situation created one of the most warm-hearted and meaningful work environments I’ve ever experienced.

A very Lovable Cat at out Base. She Unfortunatly didn't make it.

# Personal Encounters

Clearing flooded homes was emotionally intense. We watched people drag what was left of their lives out of the mud. Some had lost everything.

Child Toys, found in the Rubble of a collapsed Building.
Images like these, where unfortunatly very Common.

One really grounding realization was, that in many buildings, the water had never fully receded. And missing Technicall Equipment we had too Bucket the Water out Bucket by Bucket.

You can Imagen the Smell of Water and Mud lying there for Days. We even found a Refrigerator half filled with River Water and Remaining Contents. I could have done very well without this discovery.

Another Pile of Rubble and Mud we Successfully Cleared.

One of the most harrowing moments came after a shift, walking through a park. We were targeted by Russian artillery—six times. Shells landed frighteningly close.

Probably a Grad Rocket, in the same Park.

To escape, we had to repeatedly throw ourselves to the ground, to have the best chance of Dodging Shrapnels. 
Intresstingly you already can hear ~30-40 Seconds earlier when the Mortar Round shot is comming in your Direction.
Its a faint "thumb" in the Distance, thats sound like its directly in your Ear.
Then you have 30-40 Seconds (or thats what it feels like), to run for Cover.
If the Shell is comming down close to you (~300m) you will hear a high Pitched whistle. It sounds like Riping Paper.
If you hear this Whistle you have ~1 Second to throw yourself to the Ground.
The distinct high-pitched whistle of incoming shells will never leave my memory.

Here you can listen to a Shell Impact i witnessed around ~60m from the Recorder.
If you turn it loud enough you can hear the Whistle.

Thankfully, that event was nearly unique in four weeks, and most of the time civilians weren’t targeted directly. 
Attacks typically happened farther away.

And if they Occured closer, we usually had Cover close by.

# How You Can Help

One euro equals about 40 Ukrainian Hryvnia—and it goes a long way. A 1.5-liter bottle of water costs around 7 Hryvnia, meaning you can buy five bottles with just one euro.

But money alone isn’t enough. Vehicles, generators, and medical equipment often need to be purchased and shipped from abroad—they simply aren’t available locally. That’s where international help comes in.

Other ways to support:

    Stay informed about the war and share accurate information with others.

    Contact your local politicians and express your support for Ukraine—especially regarding EU membership and long-term reconstruction aid.

    Volunteer, either in front-line regions like Kherson or in safer areas like Kyiv, where you could help in a field kitchen, for example.

# Common Questions I Get

"What are the people like over there? Are they still hopeful after everything they’ve been through?"

Many who could flee have done so. Those who remain are mostly, but not only, older people who can’t or won’t leave. They are incredibly thankful for any help and deeply appreciative.

People in Kherson, who endured brief Russian occupation, were overjoyed to be free again. The stories are heartbreaking—civilians having their ears cut off, people being beaten in the streets. It’s horrifying.

And yet, paradoxically, the atmosphere is one of kindness and resilience. People help each other because they have to—there’s no room for anything else. During the rare quiet moments between shellings, it felt like the most peaceful and welcoming place I’ve ever been. I sometimes miss that feeling.

In Kyiv, most people mentally block out the war—understandably so. But across the country, Ukrainians see themselves as the shield of Europe, defending our shared freedoms and values, hoping to one day join the EU.
And they fight Viciously for it!

# Weren’t you afraid?

Honestly, it felt very different from what you see in the media. Most reporters are only on-site for a day, capture the most dramatic footage, and then leave. Their stories often don’t match what we experienced on the ground.

Russian shelling is indiscriminate—they hit playgrounds and hospitals, both of which I witnessed. But most of the time, strikes were far away. When it got closer, we had a good basement shelter at our hub. As civilians, we generally weren’t direct targets.

There were only two moments in six weeks when it got truly dangerous.

I don't want to downplay my experiences or those of others, but it's nowhere near as bad as some people make it out to be when you go there to provide humanitarian aid and help people.  Yes, there is a risk involved. But helping as many people as I was able to there made it all worthwhile.  And I can only recommend that everyone forms their own opinion.  
And in all Honesty in my Opinion way too much People in Europe / Germany are way too Comfortable for doing nothing for Peace.
But thats a whole Discussion in itself.

Allmost all the Time it feelt like making a miniscule but very important Difference.
I was very Honored to be a Part of the Volunteer Group. 
Great People, with a Big Heart, that would Risk their live to Save People, and go Above and Beyond todo so.
I never felt so welcomed in a Group, like there.

Yes, there were moments, but on the whole I wasn't afraid. I had reliable, open friends around me who gave a lot to help others.
And I often think back to this somehow very big Flame of hope in those desperate Situation.

And i am really looking forward too return and Help again. 
Perhaps not until after the war, but i am Eager to Help more.

Stay Safe!
