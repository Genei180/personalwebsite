# Mammutmarsch Munich 2021 – Part 1

The Mammutmarsch: a march where 100 km must be completed within 24 hours. Why this is just as insane as it sounds, why it's still worth experiencing, how you can prepare for it, and what I learned from the Mammutmarsch – you'll find out in this blog post.

## Preparing for the Mammutmarsch

Altogether, our group completed eight training marches – including one rather unique challenge that gave us a lot of valuable insights. You can read more about that in the final section and here: [The David Goggins 4x4x48 Challenge](./DavidGogginsChallenge.md).  
The other seven training marches gradually increased from 44 km to 64 km. To increase intensity, we did the last four training marches at roughly two-week intervals. Before the actual Mammutmarsch, we took a rest period of about five weeks.  
I highly recommend that anyone planning to do a 100 km Mammutmarsch completes at least one 50 km test march. That should help you determine whether your gear and strategy are suitable.

## Gear Used for the Mammutmarsch

To make sure I forgot nothing, I created a checklist. You can see all my gear laid out in the image above. It's worth noting that we were relatively heavily packed. Other Mammuts traveled much lighter, relying more on compact food or the aid stations. My gear included:

**Clothing:**

- Rain jacket
    
- Fleece jacket
    
- Thermal underwear
    
- Sportswear
    
- Running shoes
    
- Running socks
    
- Headwear
    

**Miscellaneous:**

- Hydration bladder
    
- Flashlight
    
- Power bank
    
- Mosquito repellent
    
- Tissues
    
- Headphones
    
- Documents (ticket / COVID declaration / vaccination card)
    
- First aid kit
    

**Snacks:**

- Banana
    
- Granola bars
    
- Protein bars
    
- Chocolate
    
- Dextrose
    

**Meals:**

- Pesto pasta 500g
    
- Cream cheese & bacon pasta 250g
    
- 2x Peanut butter–banana–honey sandwiches
    
- Tuna–tomato–rice 500g
    
- 2x Salami & farmhouse bread
    
- Fork
    

**Electronics:**

- Phone
    
- Smartwatch
    

## The Cold Problem

Even during training, we noticed: the longer the march, the less energy your body has to keep warm. By the end of the Mammutmarsch, despite wearing gear that would normally keep me warm at –10°C, I was nearly freezing. That was likely due to the heavy rain and the 12°C temperature we had to endure.

Personally, the cold hit my bones quickly during the test marches. This immediately affected my mobility, pain levels, and overall comfort. My knees and shins started acting up fast. That's why I highly recommend packing warm clothing regardless of the weather forecast. The night alone will challenge you. For me, multifunctional thermal underwear and a fleece jacket were perfect, offering a wide temperature range without being too hot or too cold.

## The Rain Problem

Another advantage of multifunctional clothing is how quickly it dries. Unfortunately, we were hit by massive rainstorms during the night. I used my Mammut rain jacket, quick-dry sportswear, and sports socks. That worked well for me—I only got a bit wet and felt comfortable overall.  
Other participants went with waterproof trail shoes and rain ponchos that also covered their backpacks. It’s all a matter of preference. If you're not using quick-dry gear, I highly recommend bringing a change of clothes.

Shoutout to the guy who walked past us at 1 AM in the pouring rain, soaking wet, wearing just a T-shirt and joggers. Respect that you made it to the end!

## Choosing the Right Shoes

Another important topic is footwear. It goes without saying: you’ll want very good shoes for 100 km. Bad shoes don’t necessarily stop you—as the soaking wet guy with regular sneakers at 1 AM proved—but they definitely don’t make it easier. Just look at how he walked at the finish line.

For me, running shoes combined with compression socks were the ideal combo. I preferred lightweight running shoes over heavy hiking boots, though this came at the cost of waterproofing and stability. I compensated for the lack of waterproofing with good socks. In hindsight, better stability would’ve been helpful on rough terrain. Still, my setup worked out well. Among the other Mammuts, everything from light to heavy footwear was represented.

## The Right Socks

A sports store salesman once told me that the right (compression) socks matter a lot. I used to think they were just a gimmick for people with too much money. But as he explained, most people don't slip in their shoes—they slip inside their cotton socks. After doing 2x 60 km in regular socks and 100+ km in compression socks, I can confirm this 100%.

Another bonus: the socks dried quickly. Otherwise, I would’ve had completely soaked feet after the third unavoidable puddle (which spanned the whole trail). Those socks saved me more than once and likely prevented me from quitting early. I highly recommend them.

The value of good footwear and socks was summed up perfectly by a fellow finisher’s comment:

**Good shoes + good socks = Priceless**
